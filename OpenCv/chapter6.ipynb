    "## Canny Edge Detection\n",
    "#  edge detection is a technique used in image processing to identify points in a digital image where the brightness changes sharply. These points often correspond to the boundaries of objects within the image. The Canny Edge Detection algorithm is one of the most popular and effective methods for edge detection. It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986 and involves several steps to produce accurate edge maps.\n",
    "# Here is a brief overview of the Canny Edge Detection process:\n",
    "# 1. Noise Reduction: The first step involves reducing noise in the image using a Gaussian filter. This helps to smooth the image and minimize the impact of noise on edge detection.\n",
    "# 2. Gradient Calculation: The algorithm then calculates the intensity gradients of the image using techniques like the Sobel operator. This step identifies areas of rapid intensity change, which are potential edges.    \n",
    "# 3. Non-Maximum Suppression: In this step, the algorithm thins out the edges by suppressing non-maximum gradient values. This means that only the local maxima in the gradient direction are retained, resulting in thin edges.\n",
    "# 4. Double Thresholding: The algorithm applies two thresholds (high and low) to classify edges into strong, weak, and non-edges. Strong edges are those with gradient values above the high threshold, weak edges are those between the high and low thresholds, and non-edges are those below the low threshold.\n",
    "# 5. Edge Tracking by Hysteresis: Finally, the\n",
    "#  algorithm tracks edges by connecting weak edges to strong edges if they are connected. This helps to eliminate false edges and retain only the significant ones.\n",
    "# The result of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm is a binary image where the edges are highlighted. This technique is widely used in various applications, including computer vision, image analysis, and object detection.   \n",
